# Graduation-Project-2024
This is my final year graduation roject on the topic "Predicting Fuel Consumption in Heavy duty Vehicles"
PROBLEM STATEMENT
Heavy-duty trucks are responsible for a significant portion of fuel consumption in the transportation industry. This high consumption results in increased operational costs and environmental impact. Efficient fuel consumption modeling is vital for optimizing truck route planning and reducing costs. Our project aimed to develop accurate predictive models for fuel consumption in heavy-duty trucks using machine learning techniques, specifically focusing on feature subset selection methods.

Previous studies in the literature have explored various machine learning models and feature selection techniques for fuel consumption prediction. However, many existing models lack generalization due to insufficient data preprocessing, overfitting, or inadequate feature selection strategies. Our goal was to build a robust predictive model that would address these issues, providing reliable predictions.
